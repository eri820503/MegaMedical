Only used the first frame, although it seems like each subject has multiple frames available.

For Challenge2017/Scribbles, they have 3D volumes but I only use one plane. Currently Scribbles is available to process
but I haven't done so because it has very weird annotations.

Patient 90 doesn't have frame 1, currently excluded.
